  utter_general_info:
  - text: " Established in 1958, the second of its kind, IIT Bombay was the first to be set up with foreign assistance. The funds from UNESCO came as Roubles from the then Soviet Union. In 1961 Parliament decreed the  IITs as  â€˜Institutes of National Importance'. Since then, IITB has grown from strength to strength to emerge as one of the top technical universities in the world.

The institute is recognised worldwide as a leader in the field of engineering education and research. Reputed for the outstanding calibre of students graduating from its undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, the institute attracts the best students from the country for its bachelor's, master's and doctoral programmes. Research and academic programmes at IIT Bombay are driven by an outstanding faculty, many of whom are reputed for their research contributions internationally.

IIT Bombay also builds links with peer universities and  institutes, both at national and international levels, to enhance research and educational programmes. The alumni have distinguished themselves through their achievements and contributions in industry, academics, research, business, government and social domains. The institute continues to work closely with the alumni to enhance its activities through interactions in academic and research programmes as well as mobilising financial support.

Over the years, the institute has created a niche for its innovative short-term courses through continuing education and distance education programmes. In 2011, a total of 1846 degrees, including 173 Ph.D., were awarded, which represent 9.2 per cent increase in the total number of degrees awarded in the previous year. The faculty of the institute has won many prestigious awards and recognitions, including nine Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar awards.

Residents at IIT Bombay have the advantage of being located in the financial capital of India while enjoying the serenity of the Powai campus, situated in the northern suburbs of Mumbai, in Western India. A fully residential institute, with all its students staying on campus, students are accommodated in 14 hostels with in-house dining and excellent amenities for sports and other recreational facilities"
