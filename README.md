# Project Alpha
A Chatbot trained on IIT Bombayâ€™s data
This is an experimental chat bot (in it's early stage) that is set on the data of the institute, IIT Bombay.
This bot uses Rasa Open Source framework.
A lot of work still has to be done. More functionality and a larger database is to be used in future. Currently, the bot is able to tell the department of professors, the professors of a certain department, information about some events, etc. (so give it a try, maybe?)
